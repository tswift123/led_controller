Corrections to Kevin's design document:

1) I believe that the RGB color wheel will show white as a possible selection.
If so, the RGBW screen will be different from the RGB + 1 screen.  The RGBW
screen will  not have a separate bulb and dimmer wheel.

2) If the color wheel shows white, add a guard band around the white values
such that inside the guard band, white is full value and R, G, and B are zero.

3) The brightness wheel will go 25/50/75/100 and the app will send corresponding
values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the LED controller with a value of 0 indicating that
the brightness is to remain unchanged for a given channel.

4) Ignore the word "ringer" in the description of haptic values.  It may not
make sense to do haptic on the color wheel.  Anywhere that haptic does not align
with best/typical practices, we will defer to best/typical practices.

5) If swiping through operational pages doesn't conform to best/typical practices,
we will defer to best/typical practices.

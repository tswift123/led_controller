Json messages:

LED set:
    {"SetLED": {ID#: {"R": value, "G": value, "B": value, "W": value}}}
	Where ID# is a number of 1 through 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	value is the RGBW value from 0 to 255.  The white value should be
	mutually exclusive of the RGB values.  In the case of RGB+1, 
	the extra light should be indicated by a 0 or 255 in the white
	channel to signify off or on.  In the 4Channel case, the "R", 
	"G", "B", and "W" values correspond to the 4 channels and can
	contain either a 0 or 255 to signify off or on.
	e.g. {"SetLED": {1: {"R": 127, "G": 127, "B": 0, "W": 0}}}
	
brightness:
    {"SetBrightness: {ID#: {"chan1Index": ndx, "chan2Index": ndx, "chan3Index": ndx, "chan4Index": ndx}}}
	Where ID# is a number of 1 through 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	ndx is a number between 0 and 4.  Zero shall indicate that the brightness index will
	remain unchanged.  So for an RGBW LED, the same value should be send for all 4 channels.
	For an RGB+1 type controller, if the user changes the brightness on the RGB LED, the
	fourth channel (the +1) will be zero.  If the user changes the brightness on the +1
	channel, the RGB channel indexes will be zero.  Likewise, for a 4Channel controller,
	only one channel will have a value between 1 and 4 and the other three will be zero.
	e.g. (Ctrl1: (chan1Index: 3, chan2Index: 3, chan3Index: 3, chan4Index: 3), Ctrl2: {chan1Index: 0, chan2Index: 1, chan3Index: 0, chan4Index: 0}}

Configuration:
    {"SendConfig": 1}
	This requests the configuration from the controller
	
    The message below is the return message containing the configuration that will 
	come to the phone app from the controller when the app first connects to the 
	controller in order to set the types and names in the app.
	{"ConfigData: 
	              {ctrl#: 
				          {"Name": name,
						   "Type": type,
						   "ChanNames": 
						                {"Chan1Name": c1Name,
										 "Chan2Name": c2Name,
										 "Chan3Name": c3Name,
										 "Chan4Name": c4Name
										}
						  }
				  }
	}
	Where ctrl# is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	name is a custom name provided by the user for the controller
	type is one of "RGBW", "RGB+1", or "4Channel"
	c1Name through C4Name are custom names provided by the user for the four channel
	in each controller.  If the controller is of type RGBW, there is only one name for
	a channel.  An RGB+1 will have 2 names, and a 4Channel will have 4 names.
	e.g. {"Ctrl1": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Chan1", "Chan2Name": "Chan2", "Chan3Name": "Chan3", "Chan4Name": "Chan4"}}, "Ctrl2": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}, "Ctrl3": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}, "Ctrl4": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}}
	
Save Configuration:
    After the user saves various names and controller types, they can save the
	updated configuration.  The message below captures all of the configuration
	information and sends it to the controller.

	{"SaveConfig: 
	              {ctrl#: 
				          {"Name": name,
						   "Type": type,
						   "ChanNames": 
						                {"Chan1Name": c1Name,
										 "Chan2Name": c2Name,
										 "Chan3Name": c3Name,
										 "Chan4Name": c4Name
										}
						  }
				  }
	}
	Where ctrl# is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	name is a custom name provided by the user for the controller
	type is one of "RGBW", "RGB+1", or "4Channel"
	c1Name through C4Name are custom names provided by the user for the four channel
	in each controller.  If the controller is of type RGBW, there is only one name for
	a channel.  An RGB+1 will have 2 names, and a 4Channel will have 4 names.

Scene Selection:
	{keyword: value}
	Where keyword is one of "LEDScene"
	Value is a number of 1 through 4
	e.g. {"LEDScene": "1"}
	
Scene Save Configuration:
	{"SaveScene": {scene#: name}}
	Where scene# is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to the four scenes that can be saved.
	name is the custom name the user entered.
	
All Off:
	{cmd: value}
	Where cmd is "AllOff"
	value is "1"  Value does not matter.

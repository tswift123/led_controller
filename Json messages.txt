(Toms note on setting up characteristics in the peripheral)
If you are actually interested in the data written to a characteristic by the
central device, you need to enable capture when creating the characteristic such as:

recv_characteristic = aioble.Characteristic(device_service, _ENV_SENSE_RECV_UUID, write=True, read=True, notify=True, capture=True)

Then you can get the data with a written() function instead of written() followed
by a read() such as:
connection, data = await recv_characteristic.written()


Set LED:
    {ID#: {'R': value, 'G': value, 'B': value, 'W': value}}
	Where ID# is a number of 1 through 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	"R", "G", "B", and "W" correspond to the 4 channels on each controller.  
	Value is the RGBW value from 0 to 255.  
	The white value should be mutually exclusive of the RGB values and should 
	be either 0 or 255 to turn the white LED off or on.  In the case of RGB+1, 
	the RGB LED and the standalone light can be turned off or on independently.
	If a color is being set on the RGB LED, only the 'R', 'G', and 'B' channels
	should be sent in the message with the 'W' being left out.  If the +1 light
	is being turned off or on, a 0 or 255 in the white channel with no other
    channels being included in the message. In the 4Channel case, the four channels 
	can be turned on or off independently with or value of 0 or 255.  Only the
	channel being controlled should be included in the message.
	e.g.
	{'4':{'R':'255', 'G': '0', 'B': '0', 'W': '0'}}    # Controller 4 (RGBW) Channel 1 red
	{'3': {'R': '128', 'G': '128', 'B': '128))         # Controller 3 (RGB+1) set RGB LED color
	{'3': {'W': '255'))                                # Controller 3 (RGB+1) turn on +1 light
	('2': {'B': '255'))                                # Controller 2 (4Chan) turn on 3rd light
	
	
Set Brightness:
    {Ctrl#: {'R': ndx, 'G': ndx, 'B': ndx, 'W': ndx}}
	Where Ctrl# is a number of 1 through 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4.
	"R", "G", "B", and "W" correspond to the 4 channels on each controller.  
	ndx is a number between 0 and 3 to indicate 4 different brightness levels.
	For an RGBW type controller, the same value should be sent for all 4 channels. 
	For an RGB+1 type controller, there will be separate controls on the phone app
	for the RGB vs. the +1 channel.  If the brightness control is changed on the 
	RGB, the three RGB channels should be set to the same value, and only the RGB
	channels should be specified in the message, not the 'W' channel. If the 
	brighness on the +1 channel is changed, it's index should be set on the 
	"W" channel and only the "W" channel should be specified in the message.
	Likewise, for a 4Channel controller, all four channels can be controlled 
	independently, so the json message should only contain one of the channels.
	e.g. 
	{'4': {'R': '3', 'G': '3', 'B': '3', 'W': '3'}}    # Controller 4, of type RGBW with
	the brightness being set to the max.
	{'1': {'W': '0'}}    # Controller 1, of type RGB+1 with the +1 channel being set to minimum
	{'2': {'G': '2'}}    # Controller 2, of type 4Chan with the second channel being set to 2.


All Off:      
    Turn off all 4 channels on all 4 controllers.  Currently there is
	no requirement to turn all leds on.  Only one message is needed to
	turn off all 4 controllers so the "1" in cmd has no meaning.
	{cmd: value}
	Where cmd is "1"
	value is "on" or "off"
	e.g.
    {'1':'off'}
	
Scene Selection:
	{keyword: value}
	Where keyword is one of "LEDScene"
	Value is a number of 1 through 4
	e.g. {"LEDScene": "1"}
	
Scene Save Configuration:
	{scene#: name}
	Where scene# is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to the four scenes that can be saved.
	name is the custom name the user entered.  Maximum of 10 characters.  When this is
	invoked, how the LEDs are set on the 4 controllers is saved to a file.
	e.g. {'1': 'ABigName10'}}
	
Set Controller Type:
    {Ctrl#:{'Type': type, 'Name': 'ABigName10', ChanNames: {'RGBW': 'ABigName10', 'RGB': 'ABigName10', 'R': 'ABigName10', 'G': 'ABigName10', 'B': 'ABigName10', 'W': 'ABigName10'}}}
	Where Ctrl# is a number of 1 through 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4.
	Type is one of 'RGBW', 'RGB+1', or '4Chan'
	Name is the custom user entered name for the controller. Maximum of 10 characters
	ChanNames are the custom user entered names for the 4 channels on the controller. Maximum of 10 characters.
	When the type is 'RGBW', ChanNames should only contain the single key, 'RGBW' as all four channels will
	fall under the same name.  When the type is 'RGB+1', ChanNames should only contain the two keys:
	'RGB' and 'W' as the first three channels will fall under the same name.  When the type is '4Chan',
	ChanNames should contain the four keys: 'R', 'G', 'B', and 'W' with their respective names.
	
    e.g.
	{'1': {'Type': 'RGBW', 'Name': 'Cabinet', 'ChanNames': {'RGBW': 'Cabinet'}}}
	{'2': {'Type': 'RGB+1', 'Name': 'Cabinet', 'ChanNames': {'RGB': 'CabLeft', 'W':'CabRight'}}}
	{'1': {'Type': '4Chan', 'Name': 'Cabinets', 'ChanNames': {'R':'Cabinet1', 'G':'Cabinet2', 'B':'Cabinet3', 'W':'Cabinet4'}}}
	
Send Configuration:
    TBD - This is not finished or implemented yet.  If you read the config characteristic,
	you will get the first 244 characters of the json message.  However, this is a partial
	message and so will not be properly formed so it can't be decoded.
	This will probably be implemented as an LCAP channel and send the configuration file.
	
    The message below is the return message containing the configuration that will 
	come to the phone app from the controller when the app first connects to the 
	controller in order to set the types and names in the app.
	              {ctrl#: 
				          {"Name": name,
						   "Type": type,
						   "ChanNames": 
						                {"R": c1Name,
										 "G": c2Name,
										 "B": c3Name,
										 "W": c4Name
										}
						  }
				   Scenes:
				               {Scene#:name}
				  }
	Where ctrl# is a number from 1 to 4 corresponding to controller 1 through 4
	name is a custom name provided by the user for the controller
	type is one of "RGBW", "RGB+1", or "4Chan"
	c1Name through C4Name are custom names provided by the user for the four channel
	in each controller.  If the controller is of type RGBW, there is only one name for
	a channel.  An RGB+1 will have 2 names, and a 4Channel will have 4 names.
	In SceneNames, Scene# will be a number from 1 to 4 and name will be the custom
	name the user gave to each saved scene.
	e.g. {"Ctrl1": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Chan1", "Chan2Name": "Chan2", "Chan3Name": "Chan3", "Chan4Name": "Chan4"}}, "Ctrl2": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}, "Ctrl3": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}, "Ctrl4": {"Name": "Ctrl4", "Type": "RGBW", "ChanNames": {"Chan1Name": "Red", "Chan2Name": "Green", "Chan3Name": "Blue", "Chan4Name": "White"}}}

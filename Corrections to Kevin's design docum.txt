Corrections to Kevin's design document:

1) I believe that the RGB color wheel will show white as a possible selection.
If so, the RGBW screen will be different from the RGB + 1 screen.  The RGBW
screen will  not have a separate bulb and dimmer wheel.

2) If the color wheel shows white, add a guard band around the white values
such that inside the guard band, white is full value and R, G, and B are zero.
